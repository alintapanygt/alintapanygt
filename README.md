👋 Hi there, I'm Alin!

🌐 For the past 3 years, I've been crafting stunning front-end projects, weaving together a tapestry of code in 🌟 HTML5, 🎨 CSS, ✨ JavaScript, 🔷 TypeScript, and ⚛️ React. My digital creations are my playground, and I'm always adding new toys to the mix! 🛠️

🐍 I'm currently on an adventure, exploring the vast lands of Python and 📱 React Native for mobile app development. It's a journey full of challenges and triumphs, and I'm loving every step!

🎮 When I'm not coding, you can find me diving into the world of animes, strategizing over a game of chess, or losing track of time in my vast 🕹️ Steam game library. Gaming isn't just a hobby; it's my ultimate form of relaxation and my favorite antidepressant.

🐶 Meet my sidekick, Joe – a charming Chihuahua with a personality larger than life. I'm convinced he's the reincarnation of a taxi driver from a past life with his unique quirks!

🇬🇧 Currently based in the UK, I'm embracing the freelance lifestyle, collaborating on diverse projects and always eager to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and gamers.

Let's create something amazing together! 💻🌟
