##  👋 Hi there, I'm Alin! 

**🌐 Front-End Developer** : For the past 3 years, I've been crafting stunning front-end projects using 🌟 HTML5, 🎨 CSS, ✨ JavaScript, 🔷 TypeScript, and ⚛️ React. My world of code is always evolving with new additions! 🛠️ 

 **🐍 Learning Journey** : I'm currently on an adventure exploring the vast realms of Python and 📱 React Native for mobile app development. This journey is filled with both challenges and victories!

**🎮 Hobbies** : When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the world of anime, strategizing over a game of chess, or losing track of time in my extensive 🕹️ Steam game library. Gaming is not just a hobby for me; it's my ultimate form of relaxation and my go-to antidepressant.

**🐶 My Sidekick, Joe**: Meet Joe, my charming Chihuahua with a larger-than-life personality. I'm convinced he's the reincarnation of a taxi driver from a past life with his unique quirks!

**🇬🇧 Location & Work Life**: I'm currently based in the UK, embracing the freelance lifestyle. I am also currently pursuing a master's degree in business administration, and in the future, I aim to establish my own IT company. I am currently in the thesis stage and working on a project about the use of AI in businesses.I'm always excited to collaborate on diverse projects and connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and gamers.

**Let's create something amazing together! 💻🌟**
